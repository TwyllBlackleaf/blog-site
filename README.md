## Features and Technologies

- MySQL database using Sequelize
- Express.js server
- Authentication using express-session
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- Components templated with Handlebars

## Future Development Plans

While the site is fully functional, some more attractive styling would greatly enhance it; so further development will likely focus on CSS.
